<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>


<h3>Problem</h3>


<h4>What problem does this project aim to solve?</h4>
<p>Prevent dehydration across all age groups and minimize the environmental impacts of excessive water consumption, such as the production and transport of plastic bottled water.</p>


<h4>Why is this problem relevant today?</h4>
<p>A joint study from the Liq.In7 initiative, which included 3,611 children, 8,109 adolescents and 16,276 adults across 15 countries, found that more than half of the population does not reach the recommended average fluid intake for their age group. Although many meet fluid intake recommendations, several studies consistently associate mild dehydration with:</p>


<ul>
<li>Reduced endurance performance in athletes</li>
<li>Reduced cognitive performance and cognitive decline in older adults</li>
<li>Poor mood</li>
<li>Renal problems</li>
<li>Premature death</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, in the Portuguese market, 911 million plastic containers were produced for the sale of bottled water nationwide, and each bottle has a carbon footprint of 85 grams of CO₂. Nevertheless, between 2014 and 2019, per-capita bottled water consumption increased by about 30%.</p>

<h3>Existing solutions</h3>


<h4>What other similar solutions exist?</h4>
<p>Some studies show that skin hydration levels can predict mild systemic dehydration accurately if independent variables such as cream use, body mass and body temperature are included, because skin hydration largely reflects the volume of dermal interstitial fluid and water retained in the extracellular matrix. These compartments are in continuous equilibrium with plasma through capillary filtration, lymphatic reabsorption and changes in microvascular perfusion. Changes in plasma volume and systemic osmolality disturb Starling forces and dermal microcirculation, causing measurable changes in dermal and epidermal water content. For this reason, local skin hydration measures provide a physiologically grounded signal that can correlate with systemic hydration indicators (e.g., body-mass change and urine osmolality), provided variables such as cream use, sensor contact, the user’s emotional state, body mass and temperature are controlled.</p>


<p>The most common device for assessing skin hydration is the corneometer, which measures the electrical properties of the skin (bioimpedance) that vary with water content. This instrument typically uses a two-electrode (bipolar) configuration applied to the skin, which is subject to contact errors because the electrode–electrolyte double layer introduces a contact impedance that significantly affects the measured value. Another category of traditional unimodal methods is optical sensing. Detecting absorbance at bands that coincide with water absorption peaks, especially at 970 nm and 1450 nm, allows an indirect measurement of water content. While the 1450 nm wavelength has stronger water absorption, it has less penetration power in the skin and greater sensitivity to scattering than 970 nm. Therefore, combining the two wavelengths can provide a confident estimate of superficial water content. Other instruments have measured additional physical properties such as skin elasticity and specific heat to relate to skin water content.</p>

<p>However, there are academic works that present the development and evaluation of multimodal sensors aimed at highly accurate assessment of skin hydration, overcoming the inaccuracies and limitations of standard methods. The proposed system uses a multimodal approach that combines electrical and optical sensors. The tetrapolar bioimpedance technique is implemented to mitigate the impact of contact impedance and eliminate errors associated with the electrode–electrolyte double layer. Additionally, the optical sensor enables direct detection of water-related bands. Combining both modalities aims to increase sensitivity and measurement validity, providing a more robust and comprehensive tool for assessing skin dehydration status.</p>

<h3>Prototype</h3>


<h4>How the chosen prototype works</h4>
<p>Our initial prototype will be an Arduino NANO BLE connected to a Grove GSR bipolar bioimpedance sensor, a 970 nm IR LED and a photodiode that detects only that wavelength. The user places electrodes on fingers 3 and 4 and wears the wristband; the device will then perform continuous measurements, averaging values to reduce noise.</p>


<h4>What are the main features</h4>
<p>The prototype is connected to an application that communicates with the user and continuously improves the model.</p>


<h4>What improvements could be introduced to this prototype</h4>
<p>Reduce the wristband size to make it more discreet and less vulnerable to material damage.</p>
